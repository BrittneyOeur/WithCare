## Purpose
As an informal caregiver for my aunt and being acquainted with other caregivers. Collecting and managing healthcare information for caregivers is hard because many of these documents contain important information such as the patientâ€™s personal info, health history, and more. However, finding the right tools to manage this information can be even more difficult. So to empower caregivers and help alleviate that stress, I developed a health-tracking mobile application high-fidelity prototype called WithCare.

## Three Core Features:
1. Medication Management
  - Help organize and monitor medication schedules and dosages
2. Mental Well-Being Tracker
  - Record daily moods
3. Symptoms Tracker
  - Log new or ongoing symptoms

## Tools:
1. Figma
   - Developing prototype
2. Balsamiq
   - Creating wireframes
3. Notion
   - Note-taking throughout duration of 10-weeks

## Methodology
- Researched mobile application development
- Brainstormed wireframes using Balsamiq
- Conducted interviews and usability testing
- Developed high-fidelity prototype with Figma

## Results
1. Interactive Design Features
  - Developed interactive elements in the prototype to simulate real user experience
2. Enhanced User Interface
  - Integrated user feedback to refine the design, enhancing usability for caregivers of varying tech skills
3. Prototype Validation
  - Tested the prototype with target users, receiving positive feedback on the app's potential
